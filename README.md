This branch contains our final submission for Project 6 and will not be updated going forward aside from this readme.

This will be used as a comparison between further updates and what we were able to accomplish within the one-week turnaround for the project.

## Summary
Multi-API search engine that allows for *intergalactic friends* to search for a place on Earth as their next travel destination. Search fields include specific place name, locations by language spoken, and select World Wonders. Search is mainly powered by Google Places.

Results of the search include a satellite image of the destination provided by NASA, current weather information at the destination provided by OpenWeatherMap, and recent pictures geotagged with the destination uploaded to the internet provided by Flickr.
